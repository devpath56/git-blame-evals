/*
 * GIT-BLAME-EVALS — git blame for evals: every span answers to the run that made it.
 *
 * MODELLED FROM THE CODE, NOT FROM A DESCRIPTION OF IT. The identifiers, the endpoints, the module
 * boundaries and the three verdicts are read off TrueForge-Hackathon/auditor, and nothing here is
 * invented.

 * THE CODE IS IN THIS REPO AND NO BOX POINTS AT IT YET, which is a finding rather than an omission.
 * The pointers were written and every rung came back `claim-fails`: an implementation with no
 * preregistered fault set means "the only evidence that src/gate.py does what the box says is that
 * somebody wrote it". This repo has no tests at all — no test files, no self-checks. So `built` is
 * not reachable honestly, and ten unbacked claims are worse than none. Add tests, register them in
 * architecture/redproof.json, then restore `properties { "implementation" ... }` per box and the
 * rung resolves.
 *
 * THE BUG IT REPRODUCES, CF-262. A label like "LLM call 9" is unique only WITHIN a session. Reuse
 * it as a grouping key across sessions and three runs' spans merge into one claim — and every span
 * the eval collected is real, well-formed and individually valid, so nothing inside the eval can
 * notice. Only provenance can.
 *
 * WHY THE AUDIT IS NOT CIRCULAR, and it is the whole design. Ownership and the claim come from TWO
 * INDEPENDENT TrueForge views: ownership from the LIVE SSE stream, the claim from REPLAY. An audit
 * that read one view twice would be checking a copy of itself and could not fail.
 *
 * THREE VERDICTS, NOT TWO, because a claimed span the target does not own splits two ways and they
 * indict different parties: UNEVALUABLE is a fact about the EVAL (a span is held under another
 * session); UNWITNESSED is a fact about the AUDITOR (the registry never saw it, so there is nobody
 * to name). Collapsing them would let the auditor's own blind spot read as the eval's fault.
